                    <h2>MITSUBISHI Lancer 2016 - Present</h2>
                    <p>When Mitsubishi introduced the Lancer in 2007, nobody thought that the
                         carmaker would keep it into production for such a long time. But the struggling
                          Japanese carmaker couldn't afford to change it. Its finances were hit hard during the 
                          world financial crisis, and its products were already old and difficult to sell. The Lancer was 
                          supposed to save the brand, but it just couldn't do it by itself.
                        For 2016, the Mitsubishi designers reshaped the 
                        front bumper and made it bigger, and included the LED daytime 
                        running lights on the outer side-pods. Unlike many other carmakers, 
                        they didn't install LED headlights since they were too expensive to implement. 
                        On its sides, the Lancer featured a new set of side-skirts.</p>

                    <h2> MITSUBISHI Lancer Ralliart 2008 - 2011</h2>
                    <p>The car's exterior was similar to the one provided by the Evolution X, 
                        but there were some differences between them. At the front, the Ralliart 
                        version featured a small red badge on the broad black grilled
                        From its sides, the differences between these two vehicles were even more 
                        obvious since the Ralliart didn't sport an exhaust vent behind the front fenders. 
                        Moreover, the rear fenders were normal,
                        not enlarged like on its more powerful sibling. Finally, at the back, the wing mounted 
                        on the trunk didn't provide any adjustments or a refined, aerodynamic shape.

                    <h2>MITSUBISHI Lancer 2007-2015</h2>
                    <p>The ninth generation of the Lancer was available in two body versions: 
                        three-box sedan and hatchback. Most of its fame came from the rally world, where the Lancer,
                        along with the Subaru Impreza, were the last two cars that could meet the highest specifications
                        of a Group N rally configuration. Apart from the hi-spec Lancer Evolution, the regular Lancer
                        was available with other smaller, economical, engines.
                        The exterior look was fresh, with a big, trapezoidal, grille on the front and two 
                        angular headlights. The grille was extended into the front bumper. The angular shapes

                    <h2>MITSUBISHI Lancer 2003 - 2007</h2>
                    <p>Since it started to win races with the Lancer Evolution, the Lancer nameplate became more famous than 
                        the Mirage. That convinced the Japanese manufacturer to create a new lineup based on a new platform. 
                        With the seventh generation, that started to happen, and the 2003 model is the main proof of that. 
                        Unfortunately for the carmaker, it couldn't use the Lancer nameplate in Europe, so it had to use the 
                        Carisma instead, and it produced the car in the NedCar facility in the Netherlands.

                    <h2>MITSUBISHI Lancer 2000 - 2003</h2>
                    <p>It was the last Lancer based on the same platform with the Mirage. But it had almost no technical
                         connection with the Lancer Evolution, which was built on a different platform. Still, the name was 
                         known, and after all, it was a decent sedan that had plenty to offer for a regular family
                        The exterior was not Mitsubishi's strongest point, although the big, squared, horizontal headlights 
                        looked better and offered more light than on the previous generation. A slightly ascending hood and
                        paved the way to the greenhouse. The carmaker installed a set of taillights that looked too small for the car's size in the back.
                         Inside, Mitsubishi was not very concerned about high-quality materials
                         and the best finishes in its class. </p>

                    <h2>MITSUBISHI Lancer 1994 - 1996</h2>
                    <p>Every successful story has a beginning, and the modest-looking Lancer was the base for the future rally-racer 
                        named Lancer Evolution. In fact, the 1994 Lancer offered a version named GSR, which was punchy enough to
                         stir emotions in a parking lot among a few car enthusiasts, but not too much to attract more people.
                        The car's look was, somehow, bland. Its rounded shapes from the bio-design era were not very clear, 
                        like if the design team was not very sure that they had to do that. At the front, the narrow headlights
                         and grille were on the same page with other Japanese carmakers such as the Honda Civic or the 
                         Toyota Corolla. The low beltline and tall greenhouse, related to the overall height, was more 
                         conventional, like a 1990 Escort.

                    <h2>MITSUBISHI Lancer 1988 - 1993</h2>
                    <p>By 1988, the small-sized Mirage hatchback was known in the U.S. as the Colt or, under American branding, 
                        Eagle Summit or even Plymouth Colt. It was a mass-market vehicle that served well for many. Still, its 
                        three-box sedan version, the Lancer, was on its way to becoming even more famous. But not yet, though.
                        The front fascia resembled the same look as its hatchback sibling, with a narrow grille flanked by wide
                         headlights and underlined by the black trim from the bumper. However, its corner-mounted turn signals
